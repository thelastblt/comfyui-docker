# Under normal circumstances, the container would be run as the root user, which is not ideal, because the files that are created by the container in
# the volumes mounted from the host, i.e., custom nodes and models downloaded by the ComfyUI Manager, are owned by the root user; the user can specify
# the user ID and group ID of the host user as environment variables when starting the container; if these environment variables are set, a non-root
# user with the specified user ID and group ID is created, and ComfyUI is run as this user; ComfyUI is started at its default port (--port 8188); the
# IP address is changed from localhost to 0.0.0.0 (--listen 0.0.0.0), because Docker is only forwarding traffic to the IP address it assigns to the
# container, which is unknown at build time; listening to 0.0.0.0 means that ComfyUI listens to all incoming traffic; the auto-launch feature is
# disabled (--disable-auto-launch), because we do not want (nor is it possible) to open a browser window in a Docker container; to allow users to pass
# in additional command line arguments ("$@"), for example, --enable-cors-header to enable CORS and allow external web apps to interact with ComfyUI
